# Computational-Linear-Algebra
Numerical methods associated with matrices. This repo consists of method for solving Linear Systems using LU decomposition, Cholesky Factorization and forward and backwards solves for dense and banded matrices. Image Denoising using iterative methods for solving linear systems such as Gauss Siedel, Jacobi, SOR and Conjugate Gradient method.
