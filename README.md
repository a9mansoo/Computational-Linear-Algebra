# Computational-Linear-Algebra
Numerical methods associated with matrices. This repo consists of:
1. Method for solving linear systems using LU decomposition, Cholesky Factorization and forward and backwards solves for dense and banded matrices. Also includes a method for creating a 2D Laplacian matrix.
2. Image Denoising: by solving linear systems derived from the discretization of a partial differential equation using iterative methods such as Gauss Siedel, Jacobi, SOR and Conjugate Gradient method.
